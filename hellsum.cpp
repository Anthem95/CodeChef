/* Hell Sum, aka Hull Sum

	At least 1 such set exists for every N allowed by the constraints given below. 
	Constraints: 2 <= N <= 50
	N points with integer coordinates, with (-1000 <= Xi) & (Yi <= 1000)
	No 2 points collide
	No 3 points are collinear
	For each 2^n -1 non-empty subsets of points, find the size (the # of points) of its convex hull.
	Print the sum of those sizes
	For a given N, find any valid set of N points for which the answer doesn't exceed 4*10^15.

 Input: int N, which is the # of points
 Output: N lines. The i'th line should contain 2 ints, x & y.
		 Denoting coords of the i'th point.
